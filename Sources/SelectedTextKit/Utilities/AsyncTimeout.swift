/// Runs an asynchronous operation with a timeout.
///
/// This utility starts both the provided `body` task and a timeout task
/// concurrently. Whichever task completes first determines the result:
/// - If `body` finishes before the timeout, its result is returned.
/// - If the timeout elapses first, a `TimeoutError` is thrown and the other task is cancelled.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - timeout: The maximum duration to wait before throwing a timeout.
///   - isolation: The actor isolation context for running the task. Defaults to the caller's isolation.
///   - body: The asynchronous operation to run.
///
/// - Returns: The result of the `body` closure if it completes before the timeout expires.
///
/// - Throws:
///   - `TimeoutError` if the operation does not complete in the given `timeout`.
///   - Any error thrown by the `body` closure.
///
/// - Example:
/// ```swift
/// do {
///     let result = try await withTimeout(in: .seconds(2)) {
///         try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(1))
///         return "done"
///     }
///     print(result) // "done"
/// } catch {
///     print("Timeout or error:", error)
/// }
/// ```
